Well, it's been a while since I updated this blog. Although I intended to post to it more often, university studies got in the way. I did have to build a game for one of my projects and a fair bit went wrong. Murphy's Law simply kicked in at the wrong time.

Luckily I have now since graduated from my double Bachelors degree and am now studying my Bachelor of I.T. with Honours. Hopefully I can figure out my thesis topic relatively soon once my boss/supervisor comes into the office.

In the meantime, I have been researchingÂ ubiquitous computing, mobile agents and distributive systems whilst also figuring out what classes I can teach for this coming semester so I may have a couple of posts regarding that on the way as well.
