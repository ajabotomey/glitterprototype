Hi everyone,

My name is AJ and I am starting this blog so I can write about my journey as a indie game developer. I hope to be able to write about some of the lessons I have learnt either from university or just learning on my own. Â Occasionally I may brag about some of my gaming achievements or just talk about games in general.

Thanks for visiting!
