<p>God I'm really bad at these. I keep saying I'll get to these blog posts and then I never seem to follow through. But enough about that. Lately I have started my Graduate Diploma in Management (Learning) and a part of that is creating a game to eventually publish on a platform such as Steam. </p>

<p>Now, lately I have been learning lots about Game Design because I am a programmer first and foremost so I don't have a lot of experience in this area but I'd like to think that I've been chugging along just fine. </p>

<p>As a result, I have a ever growing OneNote Notebook that is constantly growing with more and more ideas and research that I have undertaken (Former researcher habits helped greatly). Soon I will eventually have my idea out there in the wild because I will be turning this blog into a bit of a development blog where I will be updating (hopefully) at least once a week with my latest progress. </p>

<p>I feel like this will force me to reflect a lot on my progress as I go along and hopefully allow me to evolve a bit as a developer. Now for some sleep because I need to be awake in a few hours and it's currently just past midnight here.</p>
