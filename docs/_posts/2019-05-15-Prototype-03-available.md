title: Prototype 03 now available
---

You can find the prototype [here]({{site.baseurl}}/glitterprototype/prototypes/prototype03).

Improvements from Prototype 02 include:
- Player can now whistle
- Player can now drop smoke bombs
- Player can throw noisemakers
- AI reacts to sound if within a certain range
    - AI then looks around once reaching the source of the sound
- AI now has Field of View visualisation

Current issues include the following: (Will add more as they arise)
- Better art. I used tile sprites from OpenGameArt.com to so the level and the player/guard are using basic Unity Sprites

Future improvements include:
- Tweaking to the sounds
- Tweaking the patrol AI a bit further
- Better UI
- Creation of the first level / tutorial
- A proper development blog. (Once I know what I'm doing that is)
- A Google Forms survey so people can start contributing feedback
