title: Prototype 01 now available
---

You can find the prototype [here]({{site.baseurl}}/glitterprototype/prototypes/prototype01).

Current issues include the following: (Will add more as they arise)
- I need to work on the camera a bit more
- Better visual feedback on the guard field of view so people can avoid it.
- Better art. I used tile sprites from OpenGameArt.com to so the level and the player/guard are using basic Unity Sprites
