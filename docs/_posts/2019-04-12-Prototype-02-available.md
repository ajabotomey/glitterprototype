title: Prototype 02 now available
---

You can find the prototype [here]({{site.baseurl}}/glitterprototype/prototypes/prototype02).

Improvements from Prototype 01 include:
- Camera now uses Cinemachine. Much nicer camera system and also has a confiner component so I can keep the camera inside the level.
- AI is slightly smarter. Upon losing the player from the Field of Vision, it will travel to the last known position to attempt to spot the player. 
..- There is some obvious tuning that is needed. I may still evolve this AI more in the near future.
- There is some UI menus starting to take shape. They are very basic but they still exist

Current issues include the following: (Will add more as they arise)
- Better visual feedback on the guard field of view so people can avoid it.
- Better art. I used tile sprites from OpenGameArt.com to so the level and the player/guard are using basic Unity Sprites

Future improvements include:
- Better UI
- Start adding some storyline elements
- A proper development blog. (Once I know what I'm doing that is)
- A Google Forms survey so people can start contributing feedback
