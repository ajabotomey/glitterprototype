So, lately I've been watching quite a few movies and TV shows getting some inspiration for my game and I came across The Circle with Emma Watson and Tom Hanks while I was looking at Digital Dystopia movies. I will admit, it was a movie I had been wanting to watch for some time but I finally got a chance to do so.

<p>So, lately I've been watching quite a few movies and TV shows getting some inspiration for my game and I came across The Circle with Emma Watson and Tom Hanks while I was looking at Digital Dystopia movies. I will admit, it was a movie I had been wanting to watch for some time but I finally got a chance to do so.</p>

<p>I figured I'd write down some notes and transcribe those notes here as a record.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, it was a frustrating movie to watch because so many of the consequences were just glossed over. No-one seemed to care for the repercussions except for Ty. Someone actually died because people were effectively harrassing him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any ethical implications of this technology were pretty much discarded as if they didn't matter at all. A senator at the start of the movie was very skeptical of the Circle due to privacy concerns and they pretty much did away with her very quickly. The Circle was quick to silence any critics and Ty was barely seen by anyone else except for Mae.</p>
